Overview
This project is a personalized movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. It leverages collaborative filtering and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to predict user preferences and recommend movies that align with their taste.

Features
Personalized Recommendations: Suggests movies based on user ratings and preferences.
Collaborative Filtering: Utilizes user rating patterns to make recommendations.
NLP Techniques: Applies text processing, including lemmatization, to enhance the accuracy of recommendations.
Streamlit Interface: Provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for users to receive recommendations.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for developing the system.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
Surprise: Collaborative filtering for building the recommendation engine.
scikit-learn: Machine learning tools for model evaluation.
TF-IDF: Text processing to extract relevant movie features.
spaCy: NLP library for lemmatization and other text preprocessing tasks.
Streamlit: Framework for creating the web-based user interface.

Usage
Launch the Streamlit app using the command mentioned above.
User Interaction:
Input your preferences by rating a few movies.
The system will analyze your ratings and suggest movies that match your preferences.
View the recommended movies in the interface.

Dataset
The system uses the MovieLens dataset for training and testing. This dataset includes user ratings and movie information, which are essential for building the recommendation engine.

How It Works
Data Collection: The system utilizes the MovieLens dataset, which contains user ratings for various movies.
Model Training:
Collaborative Filtering: A model is trained using user ratings to understand patterns and predict ratings for unrated movies.
NLP Processing: Movie descriptions are processed using TF-IDF and spaCy to extract key features that influence recommendations.
Recommendation Engine: The trained model predicts user ratings for unseen movies, and the system suggests movies with the highest predicted scores.
Evaluation
The system is evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure the accuracy of predictions. The model achieves effective prediction results, making it reliable for generating recommendations.

Future Enhancements
Incorporate Content-Based Filtering: Combine user preferences with movie content to improve recommendation accuracy.
Real-Time Recommendations: Implement a real-time recommendation engine that updates as users interact with the system.
Expand Dataset: Include additional datasets to diversify movie recommendations.
